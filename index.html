                <h3>Who are affected?</h3>
                <p>
                    The majority of the people who are affected by the dirty water problem are from poor, <br>
                    developing nations. Often, these people live in regions where clean, fresh water is not <br>
                    readily available and are too poor to afford bottled water. Especially those living in <br>
                    rural regions, who must travel long distances and back just to haul enough water to survive <br>
                    the next day.

                <h3>What is Goal #6 About?</h3>
                <p>
                    It is a tragic problem around many places in the world that communities do not have access <br>
                    to clean water or cleaning agents that help against the spread of disease. The UN SDG Goal #6 <br>
                    is committed to ensuring the solving of this issue globally. It’s list of targets simplify <br>
                    the problem and make it easier for the world to work together to support those who need potable <br>
                    water the most.
                </p>

                <h3>Where is this problem relevant?</h3>
                <p>
                    If you are a citizen of any developed nation you have probably not experienced this issue <br>
                    personally. This problem has been broadcasted on television and on the news for decades. <br>
                    The countries affected are often India, China, African nations (especially sub-saharan <br>
                    , the poorest) and in some western nations like Canada where the aboriginal population <br>
                    is constantly suffering from low governmental budgets. <br>

                <h3>When (how long) will this problem last?</h3>
                <p>
                    For global crises it is always difficult to set a deadline for their resolution. This is because <br>
                    countries can change their annual budget spent on solving the problem. The United Nations has set <br>
                    8 targets for the world to meet in order to solve this issue. Most of whom have deadlines at around <br>
                    2030, which is only a decade away. <br>

                <h3>Why should we spend money on solving this issue?</h3>
                <p>
                    By ensuring that everyone has access to clean water and sanitation mortality rates <br>
                    (especially infant mortality rates) will quickly decline. Disease will not wreak as much havoc <br>
                    in developing nations and more people will be able to spend time improving themselves <br>
                    (going to school, going to work, moving to the city) which will create a cycle of social <br>
                    development. The world will be a fairer one. <br>

                <h3>How can we start helping this issue?</h3>
                <p>
                    As one person it is certainly hard to change the world. However little changes in one’s <br>
                    life can equate to massive change when entire communities, cities, and nations are making them too. <br>
                    Maybe, you can contribute by developing more efficient ways to bring clean water, soap, and other <br>
                    cleaning agents to those in need. Help develop your country’s economy by being an active citizen <br>
                    who cares about fixing the world’s problem step by step.<br>

                    This website has been created upon the strong personal belief coming <br>
                    from within me. That belief is that: change is something that requires <br>
                    immense force and attention, and with sufficient collectiveness and <br>
                    ingenuity, humans can solve some of the most complex problems. This <br>
                    is directly tied to the sixth United Nations sustainable development <br>

                    As a long term swimmer (I have been swimming all my life), I spent many <br>
                    minutes and hours thinking about water.In the pool I swam in, there was <br>
                    approximately 2.5 million liters of water. I often would take for granted <br>
                    the amount of water contained in that pool alone. And sometimes I would <br>
                    think about the people who do not have access to clean water and sanitation. <br>

                    almost 2 billion people at risk of not being able to drink or clean themselves. <br>
                    It is not just water and cleaning that is lacking but also infrastructure. <br>

                    The COVID-19 virus has not helped in any way. It’s been just over a year since the <br>
                    world shrunk into total lockdown and closed, leaving many in a dreadful state. <br>
                    News coverage has been particularly low on this topic recently when it should be <br>
                    of utmost concern. Studies like those by Safia Jiwana and Daniel Antiporta this <br>
                    year have noticed the significant decline in potable water, soap, and detergents <br>
                    present in rural households in sub-Saharan Africa since February 2020. And it's <br>
                    not just an African problem, but a global one. A once underrepresented minority <br>
                    in Canada, the indigenous peoples, have only recently been acknowledged nationwide, <br>
                    yet they are still suffering from chronic underfunding in their water and sanitation <br>
                    departments. <br>
